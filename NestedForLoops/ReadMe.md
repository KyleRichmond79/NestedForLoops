I was in a group with Adam and Duane and we approached the project
setting up 2 our rows and columns for catnip and mint we knew we were 
working with a 2D array iterator. We set our strings and created our
first "fast" for loop [i] and nested our second "slow" for loop [j]. We
got stuck initially on this but we hit docs, stackover flow, then the
textbook but still weren't getting it to write properly so we got assistance
from Austin and his team and were able to set the correct mod and created an 
open string " " to create spacing for to be able to read easier. It took us about
2 hours to finish.
